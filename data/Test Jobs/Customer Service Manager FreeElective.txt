Customer Service Manager
TL;DR VERSION:
FreeElective Network Pvt. Ltd., based in Chennai, introduced Jodi365.com—a next-generation matchmaking platform—well before the recent wave of here-today/gone-tomorrow casual dating sites and the more-recent Tinder-for-India wannabes. (Jodi365 caters to quality singles and helps them find the right partner at their own pace, whether they are ready for marriage in the near term or want to get to know someone as friends first.) Since 2011, we have made millions of introductions. Just as important: We have a validated business model. Having recently launched a re-built, scaleable version (v.7) of our innovative, patent-pending system and a mobile app, we are growing briskly. We are also introducing Peepul365.com, a complementary wedding planning platform and marketplace that helps people discover beautiful venues, connect with curated vendors and service providers, and plan a special event.

We are looking for a smart, enthusiastic, and organized individual to manage our customer service team and address issues relating to people's use of our products.
