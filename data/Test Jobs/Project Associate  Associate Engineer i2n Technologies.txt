Job description:
Electronics Systems Engineer job includes and not limited to research, design and develop electronics systems and hardware products. Typical area of work involves signal conditioning, signal measurement & control for interface design for high tech analytical instruments and Sensors. Execution activities demand experiment with design concepts in building PoC and H/w. Liaison with vendors/consultant or procurements for
your work will be a need. Candidate should be willing to learn proactively and deliver independently in a
pivot mode, and in a StartUp culture of working. Work closely with the people from interdisciplinary branch
and appreciate multi physics capabilities in the product. There will be due emphasis on schedules, quality
