It includes a broad range of decision-theoretic approaches for the identification of the objects. In texture classification the goal is to assign an unknown sample image to one of a set of known texture classes. An image texture is a set of metrics calculated in image processing designed to quantify the perceived texture of an image and gives us information about the spatial arrangement of color or intensities in an image or selected region of an image. This project aims at providing a custom classifier which is able to classify pre-processed textural images. We propose a simple albeit effective classifier which utilizes the textural features extracted from the images and using them to compare and analyses the differences in different categories. The proposed algorithm makes use of a statistical approach where an image texture is seen as a quantitative measure of the arrangement of intensities in a region.
