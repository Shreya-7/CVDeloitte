{"NAME": "Asing Chang", "ABOUT": "I am a simple man who loves technology, science,  human behavior, and his family. I guess I am not alone. Here is a few things about me:\n\n1. I love to see how human being human. It fascinates me when I saw designs that echo the beautiful heart of the mind behind. This led me to believe that for any commercial product, a genuine human experience must be the number zero feature. \n\n2. I believe people are incredibly generous. If we can help just one person touch his or her own generosity each day, the world will be a much happier place. This inspires the creation of The Cogiver Network I hope join me and give your kindness a warm hug at http://cogiver.com.\n\n3. I am a dad of 2 ever running boys. For this reason, I shoot 1D Mk3 (sorry Nikon fans); After I retire, I want to be the geekiest comedian on YouTube. \n\n4. LinkedIn is the network where things greater than ourselves get started, so if I can add value to your mission, connecting to me is just one click away.\n\nSincerely\nAsing", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "University of East Anglia", "Degree Name": "MSc", "Field of Study": "Computer Science"}, {"Institute Name": "China Junior College of Commerce and Management", "Degree Name": "Associate of Science (AS)", "Field of Study": "Information Systems"}], "SKILLS": ["Distributed Systems", "business model development", "Scrum", "Software Engineering", "Scalability", "Digital Direct Marketing", "Web Services", "Nonprofits", "Algorithms", "Object Oriented Design", "Disruptive Technologies", "C++", "Online Advertising", "Win32 API", "User Experience", "C#", "Marketing Strategy", "Entrepreneurship", "Software Design", "Windows Azure"], "EXPERIENCE": [{"Company Name": "Volt Technical Resources", "Designation": "Contractor SDE for Microsoft ePeriodicals", "Location": "Redmond", "Start Date": "6/2003", "End Date": "4/2004"}, {"Company Name": "Microsoft", "Designation": "Software Design Engineer, Windows 8, Device Experience", "Location": "Redmond, WA", "Start Date": "7/2009", "End Date": "3/2010"}, {"Company Name": "Microsoft", "Designation": "Software Design Engineer, Windows Vista", "Location": "Redmond, WA", "Start Date": "4/2004", "End Date": "10/2006"}, {"Company Name": "Microsoft", "Designation": "Software Design Engineer, Windows 7, Device User Experience", "Location": "Redmond, WA", "Start Date": "11/2006", "End Date": "7/2009"}, {"Company Name": "Wallet2.com", "Designation": "Entrepreneur", "Location": "Kirkland, WA", "Start Date": "6/2010", "End Date": "1/2013"}, {"Company Name": "Freelance SDE Consultant", "Designation": "Consultant/Dev Lead", "Location": "Taipei, taiwan", "Start Date": "8/2000", "End Date": "8/2001"}, {"Company Name": "Microsoft Taiwan", "Designation": "Software Design Engineer", "Location": "Taipei, Taiwan", "Start Date": "12/1996", "End Date": "6/1998"}, {"Company Name": "Microsoft", "Designation": "Vendor SDE - Applied Science Group", "Location": "Redmond, WA", "Start Date": "9/2016", "End Date": "3/2019"}, {"Company Name": "SymbioSys@Microsoft", "Designation": "Software Design Engineer", "Location": "Redmond, WA", "Start Date": "6/1998", "End Date": "12/1999"}, {"Company Name": "Microsoft", "Designation": "Research SDE", "Location": "Redmond, WA", "Start Date": "4/2019", "End Date": "Present"}, {"Company Name": "Microsoft Taiwan", "Designation": "SDE", "Location": "NA"}, {"Company Name": "Microsoft", "Designation": "Vendor SDE - Microsoft Band", "Location": "Redmond WA", "Start Date": "5/2014", "End Date": "9/2016"}, {"Company Name": "The Cogiver Network", "Designation": "Founder", "Location": "Seattle, WA", "Start Date": "1/2013", "End Date": "Present"}], "LICENSES & CERTIFICATION": [], "COURSES COMPLETED": [], "PROJECTS TAKEN": [], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": [{"Language Name": "Chinese", "Proficiency": "NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL"}, {"Language Name": "English", "Proficiency": "FULL_PROFESSIONAL"}]}
