{"NAME": "Atri Sharma", "ABOUT": "I am an experienced technical leader in the space of distributed databases and have worked on multiple database engines. I have been a major contributor to PostgreSQL, where I implemented major features like JDBC Foreign Data Wrapper, Ordered Set Aggregates, ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING and GROUPING SETS. I have implemented major features in Greenplum, such as large objects support, complex numbers datatype, resource management and miscellaneous improvements in query optimiser. \n\nI have been a part of CosmosDB, where I worked on scaling CosmosDB to be a true HTAP engine. I lead the Columnar engine effort, was working on improving indexing efforts within the product, and was generally responsible for setting the technical direction and leading the group to make CosmosDB a fully functional analytical database engine\n\n I am an open source exponent and am PMC Member and Committer for various open source database engines, such as Apache Apex, Apache HAWQ and Apache MADLib. I also help new projects to incubate in Apache Software Foundation.\n\nI am currently focused on Presto, where I am working on scaling Presto to be a fully functional OLAP engine. I have recently released functionality to scale Window Aggregates infinitely, allow sort nodes to scale infinitely, improve subquery planning, improve semijoin execution performance, implement FILTER clauses for aggregates, improve optimizer's capabilities to push down disjunctive predicates. I collaborate with the Presto community on multiple features and am currently helping on improvements for the cost based optimiser.\n\nI have filed 20 odd patents in the space of distributed databases and query optimization.\n\nI am an active speaker across multiple data conferences, having spoken at ApacheCon Big Data, PostgreSQL Conf, Open Source Summit multiple times.\n\nSome of my published interviews are available below in links section", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "JIIT,Noida", "Degree Name": "Bachelor's Degree", "Field of Study": "Information Technology"}, {"Institute Name": "Jaypee Institute of Information Technology", "Degree Name": "B.Tech", "Field of Study": "Information Technology"}], "SKILLS": ["Subversion", "Bash", "Linux", "Shell Scripting", "Databases", "Git", "C++", "Open Source", "Database Design", "Data Structures", "Relational Databases", "Scalability", "Distributed Systems", "Storage Systems", "PostgreSQL", "Algorithms", "Programming", "File Systems", "C", "Java"], "EXPERIENCE": [{"Company Name": "Amazon", "Designation": "SDE - Intern", "Location": "Bengaluru Area, India", "Start Date": "2/2014", "End Date": "7/2014"}, {"Company Name": "Amazon", "Designation": "Query Processing Architect", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "1/2019", "End Date": "12/2019"}, {"Company Name": "Teradata", "Designation": "Software Engineer, Teradata Labs", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "8/2014", "End Date": "3/2015"}, {"Company Name": "Barclays", "Designation": "Assistant Vice President , Data Systems and Insights", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "3/2015", "End Date": "11/2015"}, {"Company Name": "The Apache Software Foundation", "Designation": "PMC Member and Committer, Apex, MADLib, HAWQ", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "4/2015", "End Date": "Present"}, {"Company Name": "State Street", "Designation": "AVP - India Leader, Database Kernel Engineering", "Location": "Bangalore", "Start Date": "6/2018", "End Date": "1/2019"}, {"Company Name": "The Apache Software Foundation", "Designation": "Committer, Apache Lucene and Solr", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "9/2019", "End Date": "Present"}, {"Company Name": "Microsoft", "Designation": "SDE II", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "7/2016", "End Date": "6/2018"}, {"Company Name": "Pivotal Software, Inc.", "Designation": "Staff Software Engineer", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "11/2015", "End Date": "7/2016"}, {"Company Name": "Intuit", "Designation": "Principal Software Engineer", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "12/2019", "End Date": "Present"}, {"Company Name": "PostgreSQL Global Development Group", "Designation": "Hacker", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "4/2012", "End Date": "12/2019"}], "LICENSES & CERTIFICATION": [], "COURSES COMPLETED": [], "PROJECTS TAKEN": [{"Title of Project": "Complex Numbers Type in GPDB", "Description": "Add Complex Numbers type to GPDB", "Start Date": "4/2016", "End Date": "4/2016"}, {"Title of Project": "C Buildpack for Heroku", "Description": "A buildpack for C language which enables Heroku to support my favourite language on their platform.", "Start Date": "11/2012", "End Date": "11/2012"}, {"Title of Project": "JDBC Foreign Data Wrapper-- Google Summer Of Code 2012", "Description": "JDBC_FDW is a foreign data wrapper that uses JDBC to connect to the foreign database and fetch data from foreign database into PostgreSQL databases.As JDBC_FDW uses JDBC,therefore,it can be used to connect and fetch data from any data source that supports JDBC.\n\nThe project is primarily in C with some part in Java.", "Start Date": "4/2012", "End Date": "8/2012"}, {"Title of Project": "Implementation of WITHIN GROUP -- ordered set functions in PostgreSQL", "Description": "The aim of the project is to design and implement ordered set functions i.e. WITHIN GROUP keyword in SQL as defined by SQL Standard.
