Fine classing and Coarse Classing done for all the continuous and categorical variables .Initially the variables with very low IV/predictive power were dropped from the model. Categories or groups of the variables were replaced by their corresponding WOE values. Total population was split into 70% development and 30% validation sample.By running logistic regression in SAS on the development sample, the significant variables were  selected for the model. Logistic equation for the final significant variables was run on the validation sample to validate the model.\n                        Inference : Performance metrics , KS was 37.8 and there was no break in the rank ordering which  indicates the model is efficient . Actual and predicted log odds were quite close with little under prediction in the last decile. KS was 36 for the validation sample which indicates the model validates well on the validation sample.\n\nTools: SAS , Excel.\n", "Start Date": "12/2016", "End Date": "12/2016"}, {"Title of Project": "Financial Integration and Economic Growth: A Panel Data Analysis in BRICS Nation", "Description": "Objective: Study the financial integration among the BRICS nations for the period March 2004 to March 2016 using time series and panel econometric techniques.", "Start Date": "5/2016", "End Date": "5/2016"}], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": [{"Language Name": "Hindi", "Proficiency": "LIMITED_WORKING"}, {"Language Name": "English", "Proficiency": "PROFESSIONAL_WORKING"}, {"Language Name": "French", "Proficiency": "LIMITED_WORKING"}, {"Language Name": "Bengali", "Proficiency": "FULL_PROFESSIONAL"}]}
