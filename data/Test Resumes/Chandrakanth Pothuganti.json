At Citrix, a distributed version of this load balancer is developed (Cluster). In few deployments, a lot of traffic is steered (exchanged) between the nodes of distributed system, this results in wastage of available bandwidth. I have come up with a Neural Network model that predicts the traffic distribution. Based on this we are taking intelligent decisions to reduce  traffic steering between nodes of a cluster.  \n  \n"}, {"Title of Project": "Relation between NMF and frequent patterns", "Description": "This project initially started to identify software clones and progressed towards establishing the relation between existing state of the art techniques in Date Mining namely NMF (non-negative matrix factorization)  and frequent patterns. It also established relation between K-means, K-mode clustering algorithms and NMF.    "}, {"Title of Project": "Classification of encrypted traffic", "Description": "This is an initiative taken up with peer team (SDWAN) at Citrix.  SDWAN imposes user specified policies on the network traffic to prevent unfair bandwidth usage by a client/application. However, on encrypted traffic none of these policies can be applied (since data is encrypted, we cannot detect the properties of a flow). We have come up with a machine learning model that classifies the encrypted traffic in to set of predefined classes. Based on the class assigned, decisions are taken to ensure fair usage policies.
