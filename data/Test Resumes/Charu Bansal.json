It divides a continuous-time function into wavelets for a good time and frequency localisation.\n\nTwo level Self Organizing Maps (SOM) are used to cluster each base station in India into fuzzy sets. SOM is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional, discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map.\n\nFor prediction, it used a hybrid method that predicts the concentration of SO2 , NO2 , RSPM at each base station which combines differential evolution with automatic clustering technique and fuzzy logical relationships.\n\nFirst, we present an automatic clustering algorithm to cluster the historical data into intervals of different lengths. Based on the intervals obtained, the pollution data is then fuzzified into fuzzy sets. Next fuzzy logical relationships are derived which compute the predicted values. The predicted values, so obtained serve as candidate solution for optimization using modified differential evolution.", "Start Date": "1/2017", "End Date": "5/2017"}, {"Title of Project": "Witty Ceaser - The Smart Waste Management System", "Description": "This project was developed on Raspberry Pi 2 platform using Python as the chief programming language. The device aims to work in 2 aspects- automatic lid opening facility and smart trash level sensing capability. A dc motor and PIR sensors work simultaneously to sense any human movement around the bin on which the device is employed, thereby opening the bin's lid automatically. Secondly, a GSM message is sent to the municipality office when the trash level of the bin reaches to its maximum value. Messages from bins all across the city are compiled together at the municipality and an optimized route is computed using the famous Travelling Salesman Algorithm, thereby saving fuel and improving cost efficiency."}], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": [{"Language Name": "English", "Proficiency": "NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL"}, {"Language Name": "Hindi", "Proficiency": "NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL"}, {"Language Name": "German", "Proficiency": "ELEMENTARY"}]}
