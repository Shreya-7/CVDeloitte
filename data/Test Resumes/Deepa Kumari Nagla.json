Project Clarity is an open source design system that brings together UX guidelines, an HTML/CSS framework, and Angular components. Clarity\u2019s designs stem from continuous exploration and research. These designs are built into our HTML/CSS components, which can be used any web UI, regardless of the underlying JavaScript framework. Clarity also offers a set of well-designed and implemented data-bound components built on top of Angular, one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the industry. However, Clarity doesn't have an inbuilt chart library and as developer charts and graphs are the main concern. In this project, I have to build a wrapper of charts using Angular7's directive method and later build a library which supports chart for the clarity design system. Angular 7, Typescript, Clarity design system and Chart.js were mainly used in this project.", "Start Date": "1/2019", "End Date": "6/2019"}], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": [{"Language Name": "English", "Proficiency": "NA"}, {"Language Name": "French", "Proficiency": "NA"}, {"Language Name": "Hindi", "Proficiency": "NA"}]}
