Analysis of tire data curves on the basis of wheel loads for different tire pressures performed to determine slip angles corresponding to the points of maximum traction.  The suspension geometry, optimized using OptimumK and IPG Carmaker, and selected spring rates were used to complement this theoretical traction model to generate the required slip angles, camber and loads on the tire. Other parameters such as wheel scrub, mechanical trial or caster angle were also manipulated to control tire heating rate, bump steer and steering torque.\n\nI also worked on the structural design of the components of suspension and wheel assemblies. It involved modelling suspension linkages, wheel hubs and uprights (or knuckles) for wheel assemblies with requisite strength and minimum weight. Considerations for the selection of materials and manufacturing processes for the design were governed by the finances of the project, therefore, a trade-off was often involved between performance and cost.\n\nROLE AS TEAM CAPTAIN\nMy responsibilities involved project scheduling, resource planning, corporate dealing for finances and sponsorship, supervision of vehicle manufacturing, assembly and testing, team logistics, administrative formalities and holistic project management.
