MobileTracker was one of the key-applications which Samsung recently developed. In case a mobile is stolen and its SIM is replaced, a help message containing the current phone number will be automatically generated and sent to a previously registered phone number without the user\u2019s notice. \u2018MobilePrayer\u2019 is an alarm-like application with the provision of selecting different religious songs and wallpapers.\n                  As part of BADA apps, I developed two applications - JalTaarang and FastNote. JalTaarang as the name suggests is an app to play the musical instrument \u2018JalTaarang\u2019 on screen. FastNote is a screen capturing application. Whatever you write on the screen using the stylus, it will be captured and saved in an image file. This is particularly useful to note down something quickly on the screen without using the keypad or virtual editor of the phone which is much time-consuming Recently, JalTaarang has been uploaded to Samsung BADA App Store.\n", "Start Date": "8/2009", "End Date": "9/2010"}], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": [{"Language Name": "Hindi", "Proficiency": "PROFESSIONAL_WORKING"}, {"Language Name": "Bengali", "Proficiency": "NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL"}, {"Language Name": "English", "Proficiency": "PROFESSIONAL_WORKING"}]}
