{"NAME": "Kumar Shivam", "ABOUT": "Born and brought up in a small town in Bihar in India, I had my first exposure to computers in class 4th. I wrote my first 'Hello World' program in C when I was in class 9. It was then that I knew where my interest lied, \"Computers\". I completed my +2 from DPS Bokaro and my BTech from MIT, Manipal.\n(PS:- Manipal is a beautiful university town situated on the west Konkan coast near Mangalore.)\n\nIn the summer of 2017, I worked as an SDE summer Intern at Microsoft, Hyderabad. I was exposed to a lot of new technologies such as Azure Cloud, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, OpenCV, Raspberry PI, Agile Project Management. I was then offered a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO).\n\nI did one more 4-month internship with Microsoft, Hyderabad as an SDE intern. This time I worked with front-end (Angular5), backend (Azure Search, Microsoft Bot Framework) and Accessibility. \n\nI am currently working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. In a span of a little more than a year, I have worked on making two applications Accessible. I have also had a chance to work on the end to end implementation for an analytics report based on surveys. I have worked on the various front end and back end components during the period.\n\nMy interests are Computer Vision, Algorithms, Machine Learning. I am open to doing hacks on projects apart from my daily work. It would be a great opportunity if I can be of any help to anyone. I have a keen interest in software development and exploring the nitty-gritty of development. I am always open to learn new things and improve upon myself.\n\nLastly, I would like to say that I live with the motto,\n\u201cI am learning all the time. The tombstone will be my diploma.\u201d\n", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "Delhi Public School, Bhagalpur", "Degree Name": "High School", "Field of Study": "High School"}, {"Institute Name": "Manipal Institute of Technology", "Degree Name": "Bachelor of Technology (BTech)", "Field of Study": "Computer Science"}, {"Institute Name": "Delhi Public School, B.S.
