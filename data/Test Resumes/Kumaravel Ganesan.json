Print Apps enable quick and easy navigation and print from the web right from a HP Web-enabled printer - no PC needed. Printer user can choose from a growing library of print apps that make printing faster, simpler and more useful than ever.\n\nPrint Apps run as HP\u2019s Web services and seamlessly integrate with HP\u2019s web-enabled printers. Firstly upon user interaction Print Apps remotely project a graphical user interaction and controls on to the Web-enabled Printer. Secondly upon user item selection, it acquires HP owned or third-party Web content and generates/renders an appealing print content and finally in response to user print request it mediates the request to another print rendering cloud service \u2013 ePrint service - which deliver print job to the printer. Print App archetype is characterized by low latency, high responsive, pre-defined printer UI flows, Web and custom content acquisition; and Internet security.\n\nSIPs Basic Server provides the execution environment for the Print Apps. It also provides many services required by the Print Apps. These services include Security-Service, Load-Balancer, and Reverse-Proxy Service with cache and Proxy Service with cache. Security Service uses HTTP-Digest and OAuth protocol to ensure secure communication between Printer, Print App and the ePrint Service.", "Start Date": "8/2009", "End Date": "6/2010"}, {"Title of Project": "Web Print Platform - Generation II", "Description": "ePrint-II is focussed on cost e\u000bective implementation of HP Web Print Platform.

SBS Cloud Service accesses the Feed XML and Content hosted on a Content Feed Service. SBS generates User Interface on the printer and handles the navigation based on the content tree for a given App. Content is grouped into categories, and categories contain either other categories or printable documents. This forms a content tree that user navigates and selects documents to print.
