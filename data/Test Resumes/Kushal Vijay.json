{"NAME": "Kushal Vijay", "ABOUT": " \nI am a pre-final year undergrad at National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, \nI have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world. Moreover, I love to give back to the community by actively participating and organising community events like seminars, workshops, hackathons etc.\nThere's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.\nGithub: github.com/KushalVijay\nCodechef: www.codechef.com/users/kushal8118\nGeeksforGeeks: https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/KushalVijay/profile\nSkills:\nLanguages: Python, C++, C#\nDevelopment: Web Development, Web Scraping, Natural Language Processing\nTools/Framework: Django, Azure, Pycharm, Visual Studio\nArea of Interest: Natural Language Processing, Backend Development, System Design\nGeneral: Data Structures, Algorithm, OOPs with C++\nOthers: Heroku, Github, Git, TensorFlow, Rest APIs ", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "St. Stephen's Sr. Sec.
