{"NAME": "Madhuri Jain", "ABOUT": "For a quick-start, I would simply mention Java Technology as my best friend who's with me since my school days. I have been working with Java for almost a decade especially pertaining to it's utility for back-end purpose.\nTo add more, I'm a passionate CS engineer who's always on for:\n\u2022\tSoftware Development with respect to both :\n                             - Application Software (Web or Stand-alone, exploring my ways through)\n                             - System Software (I would love to have my hands-on)\n\u2022\tOperating Systems and Computer Architecture (music to my ears, lot to learn)\n\u2022\tDatabase Management (omnipresent)\n\u2022\tEmbedded and Real Time Systems (alien to me, hence adventurous)\n\u2022\tRobotics (that gives a true feel of engineering)\n\u2022\tAnd lots of never-ending learning and coding...\nIt feels great to see my lifeless program turning into a live, running and jumping process! :D\n\nand in leisure times-\nTraits of a geek like reading and learning to excel in the technical jargon, exercise team spirit via management and participation in various sports and stage events, choreography and confidence building etc.\n\n- Never learnt to give up and would always give my 100% in whatever job I do\n- Life-long challenge is to expand the scale of my 100%\n- I'm a hard-core CSE person, so it's always either 0 or 1 :)", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "National Institute of Technology , Patna", "Degree Name": "Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.)",
