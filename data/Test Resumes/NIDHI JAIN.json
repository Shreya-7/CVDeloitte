In this project, I worked on migrating the deployment pipeline from FDHE to Autopilot model. \n1. Adding migration logic to the host agents \n2. Each host plugin requires a few settings to start up which are stored in a remote server. In FDHE deployment engine was responsible for rolling out the settings to each node. In Autopilot this is solved using Autopilot data deployment. A parser was written to fetch the agent specific settings. \n3. Adding service restart and heartbeat watchdogs to the plugins for monitoring purpose. \n4. Deploying the agents across the fleet. \n5. Brown bags for VNET/DataPath team on Autopilot deployment. \n ", "Start Date": "11/2017", "End Date": "Present"}, {"Title of Project": "Handwritten Character Recoginition", "Description": "Project involved implementation of various algorithms (like K-Nearest Neighbours, Neural Networks(3-Layer and 4-Layer)) for the purpose of classification of handwritten English alphabets and numerals (26 upper case, 26 lower case,10 numerals) to know the best possible method for\nclassification.
