Most of the traffic that\n flows in the data centre networks is TCP. It was shown that virtualization impacts the performance of network\n traffic, especially TCP. This impact is due to TCP\u2019s interpretation\n of losses (typically inferred by expiration of retransmission timer)\n in network as congestion. Resource sharing property of virtualization leads to inaccurate measurements of delays, in effect, leading to unpredictable TCP behaviour. This makes study of behavior of TCP in virtual environments very important. There\n is no comprehensive study done on behavior of various TCPs in\n virtual environment. \n\nThis paper studies the performance of TCP Reno, Vegas, Cubic and Illinois in Xen virtualized environments and finds the best suitable congestion control mechanism for TCP in virtual networks by analysing the reason behind their different behavior."}, {"Title of Project": "VMCloak \u2013 A hypervisor based solution for protection of privacy and confidentiality of application\u2019s data from a compromised operating system", "Description": "Using encryption as a tool, VMCloak cryptographically isolates applications in different protection domains.
