{"NAME": "Preet Dhupar", "ABOUT": "I am working as the CFO at IKEA India. \nAs someone who believes strongly in challenging myself and constantly learning, I moved to IKEA after working for 14 years in the media industry; having worked in India and briefly in London with BBC Global News and BBC Worldwide.\n\nI\u2019m currently part of the leadership team at IKEA in India and 2018 has seen us open the first store in India in Hyderabad to our customers. From strategy to implementation; from concept to \noperations - that\u2019s the part of the journey that gives me immense satisfaction and  I enjoy the most. \nMy roles have taken me to companies starting up in India and it gives tremendous satisfaction to continue to see the growth. The 14 years at the BBC also included starting new businesses including Lonely Planet ( then owned by the BBC) \n\nIn my current as well as previous roles, finance, tax, strategy, planning and analysis, risk management and compliance and governance and legal have been part of my role.\n\nWorking with people is the other aspect I feel most connected to. I have contributed to building diverse, strong, free thinking, high performing teams who take pride in their work and enjoy what they do. I take succession planning seriously and believe in builiding leadership within the teams. Working in large organisations and the breadth of my roles has also given me a lot of good experience with different organisation structures, boards and matrix structures", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "NA", "Degree Name": "B Comm (Hons)", "Field of Study": "Commerce"}, {"Institute Name": "Insitute of Chartered Accountants of India", "Degree Name": "CA", "Field of Study": "NA"}], "SKILLS": ["ERP", "Mergers & Acquisitions", "Accounting", "Financial Analysis", "Business Strategy", "Start-ups", "Business Process Improvement", "Project Planning", "Leadership", "Strategic Financial Planning", "Risk Management", "Cross-functional Team Leadership", "Team Management", "Strategy", "Finance", "Managerial Finance", "Management", "CRM", "Forecasting", "Business Planning"], "EXPERIENCE": [{"Company Name": "BBC World India", "Designation": "Director Finance and Operations", "Location": "New Delhi", "Start Date": "2/2000", "End Date": "1/2013"}, {"Company Name": "Becton Dickinson India", "Designation": "Financial Planning Manager", "Location": "NA"}, {"Company Name": "IKEA Group India", "Designation": "CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER", "Location": "Gurgaon", "Start Date": "4/2014", "End Date": "Present"}, {"Company Name": "BBC Global News", "Designation": "Chief Operating Officer India", "Location": "New Delhi", "Start Date": "1/2013", "End Date": "4/2014"}], "LICENSES & CERTIFICATION": [], "COURSES COMPLETED": [{"Name": "Business Development Leadership programme at IKEA", "Description": "NA"}, {"Name": "Integrating Strategy and FInance", "Description": "NA"}, {"Name": "Leadership", "Description": "NA"}], "PROJECTS TAKEN": [], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": []}
