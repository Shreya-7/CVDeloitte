A user would call at a number provided by us, speak what he/she wants to know or do and our systems would handle the rest and return the result via an SMS.\n\nWe used a lot of technologies to build this. First of all to receive a call from the general public we needed a public phone number and an API which transfers the voice query from the phone call to our web-server. We used Exotel's API for that. Once we received the audio query, we first convert it to the default language English(en-US), then once we have the text for the query the possibility to do with it are endless, like parsing it and using various APIs like IBM Watson, Alchemy, Wolfram Alpha, Google Search, DuckDuckGo etc.\n\nWe used various methods to cluster requests into various categories using natural language processing and machine learning and make the query to the right API like Watson, Wolfram Alpha, Duck Duck Go and google maps etc. to get the best answer for the user.", "Start Date": "10/2015", "End Date": "10/2015"}], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [{"Title": "1st Position", "Issue Date": "3/2016"}, {"Title": "1st Position", "Issue Date": "3/2015"}, {"Title": "1st Position", "Issue Date": "10/2015"}], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": [{"Language Name": "English", "Proficiency": "NA"}, {"Language Name": "Hindi", "Proficiency": "NA"}, {"Language Name": "French", "Proficiency": "NA"}]}
