The project comprises of various modules including Customer, Resource Center, Product, Equipment, Driver, Tour, Admin and other auxiliary modules. The multi layered test driven development (TDD) project that includes User Interface as separate layer developed in WPF/XAML using MVVM and Prism 4.0 design pattern. The Business Logic, Business Entities, Data Access Layer and other common layers has been developed as separate layers. To communicate with UI and business layers, we have developed WCF service that has been accessed via Proxy at UI side.
