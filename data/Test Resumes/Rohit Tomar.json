{"NAME": "Rohit Tomar", "ABOUT": "Multi discipline techno commercial experience in aviation gathered over the last 14 years. With a penchant for problem solving, I have worked in various areas of commercial aviation including Engineering Purchase, Ground Operations, Fleet planning and Aircraft leasing, Cost Control and Finance departments. The collective experience in aviation in each of these areas strengthened the holistic approach that I bring together for problem solving within the commercial aviation industry. Personally, inclined to mentor new generation aviators to see the \u201cLarger picture\u201d and train their minds to solve complex business problems. \nIn a razor thin margin Industry, airlines need to manage resources efficiently, develop effective controls within the organization and maintain agility to compete swiftly. Often KPI\u2019s that drive the airlines financial parameters as viewed by the shareholders are not the true representation of the impending risks for an airline. Often expertise in one field of operations of airline is hired to fix a problem, but for an airline operating under high risk, it is not a single variable problem and airline is not the business of maximization of profit or minimization of cost. I help teams to develop the profit optimization view of airline business. \n\nSpecialties: Airline Finance, Airline commercial strategy, Airline Cost Management, MRO Management, Ground Handling Management, Aircraft Lease Management, Engineering Procurement, Contract Management", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "City University London", "Degree Name": "Msc; Msc", "Field of Study": "Air Transport Management; ATM"}, {"Institute Name": "NA", "Degree Name": "Bachelor of Engineering", "Field of Study": "Mechanical"}, {"Institute Name": "Frankfurt University of Applied Science", "Degree Name": "Master of Business Administration (MBA)", "Field of Study": "Aviation/Airway Management and Operations"}], "SKILLS": ["Airline Management", "Six Sigma", "Market Analysis", "Aircraft", "Contract Management", "Aircraft Lease Contracts", "Management", "Airlines", "Quality Management", "Airline Quality Management", "Aircraft Engines", "EASA 145 Setup", "Maintenance & Repair", "Aviation", "Maintenance Management", "Airline Cost Optimization", "Lean Six Sigma Green Belt", "Engine Shop Visit Management", "Maintenance Cost Optimization", "Airline Maintenance Contracts"], "EXPERIENCE": [{"Company Name": "VietJet Air", "Designation": "Head of Finance & Director of Financial Planning and Analysis", "Location": "Vietnam", "Start Date": "5/2019", "End Date": "Present"}, {"Company Name": "KPMG", "Designation": "Sr. Consultant Aviation", "Location": "New Delhi Area, India", "Start Date": "3/2015", "End Date": "4/2016"}, {"Company Name": "Aurion Aviation Advisors", "Designation": "Engineering Specialist \u2013 Maintenance Consultant", "Location": "Saudi Arabia", "Start Date": "3/2011", "End Date": "2/2012"}, {"Company Name": "KPMG", "Designation": "Manager, Strategy and Operations", "Location": "Gurgaon, India", "Start Date": "4/2016", "End Date": "5/2019"}, {"Company Name": "GoAir", "Designation": "Sr. Technical Officer", "Location": "Mumbai", "Start Date": "2/2012", "End Date": "9/2013"}, {"Company Name": "KPMG India", "Designation": "Associate Director", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "4/2018", "End Date": "3/2019"}, {"Company Name": "Spicejet Limited", "Designation": "Manager Projects", "Location": "Gurgaon, India", "Start Date": "7/2014", "End Date": "3/2015"}, {"Company Name": "GoAir", "Designation": "Asst.
