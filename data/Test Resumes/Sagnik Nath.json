{"NAME": "Sagnik Nath", "ABOUT": "Ever since I played Age of Empires, on a computer which would only be found in a museum today, I knew I wanted to code and be around computers and I have done so since i was 12 years old. I consider programming to be more art than science and its power to change the world continues to inspire me.\n\nI started my career working at Microsoft's incredible Azure Big Data team where I spent upwards of 3 years working on a variety of projects ranging from possible the largest data migration ever undertaken to Geo Replication systems. Everything I know about large scale distributed systems and design is credits to the incredible people I have worked with here.\n\nAfter Microsoft, I decided to join Rooter, which is a sports based social media platform, as the Head of Engineering, fulfilling a long time intent of working at an agile small scale startup and am poised to deliver the vision of rooter to become India's largest sports fan community.\n\nOutside of work, I love to swim, read books,  and play blues and rock on my gorgeous Stratocaster. I find playing guitar to be the perfect creative outlet, complementing my left brain activities.", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "NA", "Degree Name": "Bachelor's degree", "Field of Study": "Computer Science"}, {"Institute Name": "Jadavpur University", "Degree Name": "Bachelor's degree", "Field of Study": "NA"}], "SKILLS": ["JavaScript", "Machine Learning", "Big Data Analytics", "C", "Python", "Ruby on Rails", "Linux", "C++", "Big Data", "Java", "Matlab"], "EXPERIENCE": [{"Company Name": "Rooter Sports Technologies Pvt.
