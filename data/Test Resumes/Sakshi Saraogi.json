Mobility of server and client should not affect the services. Failure should be recovered as early as possible and requirements should be fulfilled using minimum amount of resources. \nI am involved with a research group in the Department of Information Technology, NIT Durgapur and currently working on the aforesaid project as a programmer.

Most of the existing simulators and/or emulators are not flexible in nature and their inherent limitations make them partially inefficient. This emulator is based on the service oriented architecture and all the functionalities related to it is loosely coupled, which helps the researcher to explore and/or manipulate the particular functionality on which they are working. Furthermore for evaluating the functionality of the emulator we have emulated a set of server selection and service replication schemes for different IoT scenarios in Python and have compared the results. The proposed server selection and replication schemes clearly outperforms the existing schemes for the same.", "Start Date": "9/2016", "End Date": "2/2017"}], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": [{"Language Name": "English", "Proficiency": "FULL_PROFESSIONAL"}, {"Language Name": "Hindi", "Proficiency": "FULL_PROFESSIONAL"}]}
