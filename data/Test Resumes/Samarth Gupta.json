First ever Dynamic QR Scanner AlBus App.\nWith just scanning the QR just while boarding the bus and the App will be automated to be able to provide the user with the digitalised ticket just by selecting the destination stops from the list of subsequent stops within couple of seconds.\n2. Defaulters will have a hard time. \nUsing the locations services we will be able to penalize the commuters who try to evade buying tickets of the required amount by informing the concerned authorities.\n3. Target audience is wide.\nBuses contribute to the 90% of public transport in India, this means our target audience is high. \n4. Maintain a personal profile of every user.\nAfter authenticating user on the basis of IDs we will provide options to maintain a personal profile, recharge wallet by online payments, and shows past trips of the user.\n5. Setting Automatic Alarm and Vibration\nUsing RealTime Location services, we have installed speech module that will act as a reminder in the form of alarm that will be able to alert the user when he is about to reach the destination. It gives the passenger a carefree ride.\n6.Tickets\nWe will be able to give a digitalised ticket to the user and thus we are going green. User can take the screenshot of the ticket once the payment is done after fare calculation.\n7. Albus-QR App\nThere will be a second app which will be installed permanently in the bus which will change its QR dynamically using the locations of the bus. When about to reach the destination, the QR will change.\n8.
