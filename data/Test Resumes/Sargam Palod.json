{"NAME": "Sargam Palod", "ABOUT": "As a firm believer in the fact that we are heading in a direction where finance and economy are used synonymously creating unprecedented possibilities, I have always been involved in activities that lie in the intersection of both the segments. Equipped with a Master\u2019s degree in Finance from one of the Institutes of Eminence (IoE) in India, along with CS (Executive) and CA (Intermediate), I\u2019ve had fulfilling internships in the field of Corporate Finance with my side hustles in TEDx, Toastmasters, and the United Nations. Additionally, I\u2019ve dabbled with machine learning, market research, volunteering, academic mentoring and leading teams.\n\nDuring my term at the University of Warwick (England) as an Exchange Student, I discovered my passion in the arena of Data Science and Business Intelligence. Furthermore, I'm grateful to have been selected for my second international exchange term with Peking University in China. As a graduate student from Shiv Nadar University, I want to leverage the synergy between my finance and management backgrounds to drive change, identify new market opportunities, and be amidst the remodeling of the industry.\n\nKeen on learning new skills, I've gradually developed a global mindset and tried to hone a broad spectrum of technical competencies such as Anaconda (Python), SAS, RStudio, SPSS, Tableau, Power BI, Azure ML and Advanced Excel. Outside of work, I love reading, traveling, and finding the perfect gift.\n", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India", "Degree Name": "CA - Intermediate", "Field of Study": "NA"}, {"Institute Name": "Mohanlal Sukhadia University", "Degree Name": "Bachelor of Commerce", "Field of Study": "Accounting, Finance and Economics"}, {"Institute Name": "Shiv Nadar University", "Degree Name": "MBA", "Field of Study": "Major in Finance"}, {"Institute Name": "University of Warwick", "Degree Name": "MBA - Student Exchange (100% Scholarship)", "Field of Study": "Data Science"}, {"Institute Name": "Institute of Company Secretaries of India", "Degree Name": "CS - Executive", "Field of Study": "NA"}], "SKILLS": ["SAP ERP", "SAS", "Affiliate Marketing", "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)", "Equity Research", "Tableau", "SPSS", "Advanced Excel", "Tally ERP", "Financial Modeling", "RStudio", "Python (Programming Language)", "Microsoft Azure Machine Learning", "Microsoft Power BI", "Microsoft Office", "Capital Markets", "MySQL", "Data presentation and reporting", "Project handling and implementation", "Persuasive Speaker"], "EXPERIENCE": [{"Company Name": "Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd", "Designation": "Equity Research Intern", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "5/2020", "End Date": "6/2020"}, {"Company Name": "Afflatus Website", "Designation": "Founder", "Location": "NA", "Start Date": "7/2017", "End Date": "3/2018"}, {"Company Name": "Agrawal & Mandowara Chartered Accountants", "Designation": "Articled Assistant", "Location": "Ahmedabad, India", "Start Date": "8/2015", "End Date": "6/2018"}, {"Company Name": "Reliance Industries Limited", "Designation": "Financial Planning and Analysis Intern", "Location": "Navi Mumbai", "Start Date": "5/2019", "End Date": "7/2019"}], "LICENSES & CERTIFICATION": [{"Authority": "Tally Education Pvt Ltd", "Name": "CPFA - Certificate Program in Financial Accounting, Tally.ERP9", "Issue Date": "12/2014"}, {"Authority": "Udemy", "Name": "Excel VBA and Macros", "Issue Date": "10/2019"}, {"Authority": "EDHEC Business School", "Name": "Investment management with Python", "Issue Date": "2/2020"}, {"Authority": "SAS", "Name": "Statistics with SAS", "Issue Date": "4/2020"}, {"Authority": "University System of Georgia", "Name": "Green Belt Certification (GB)", "Issue Date": "3/2020"}, {"Authority": "Duke University", "Name": "Behavioral Finance", "Issue Date": "4/2020"}, {"Authority": "Udemy", "Name": "R Programming for Statistics and Data Science", "Issue Date": "2/2020"}], "COURSES COMPLETED": [], "PROJECTS TAKEN": [{"Title of Project": "Initiating Coverage report on Titan Company Ltd.", "Description": "Evaluated a conglomerate's growth, stock pitch, equity research techniques, sensitivity analysis, \ufb01nancial modeling with DCF and Relative valuation models for intrinsic valuation.
