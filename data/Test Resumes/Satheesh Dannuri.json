This problem is NP-hard. The first approximation algorithm by Ghosh involves\ndecomposition of the polygon into O(n 4 ) convex components. This discretized prob-\nlem can then be treated as an instance of the Set Cover problem and solved in O(n 5 )\ntime with a greedy O(logn)-approximation algorithm. Later King and Kirkpatrick pro-\nposed a polynomial time algorithm for the construction an \u03b5-net of size O( 1 \u03b5 log log 1 \u03b5 ) for\nthe instances of the Hitting Set problem associated with our guarding problem. Using\nBr onnimann\n \u0308\nand Goodrich\u2019s algorithm they proposed the O(log log OPT ) approxima-\ntion factor algorithm for vertex guard problem. Here we study the VC-dimension of\nvisibility systems in polygon with holes and show that the VC-dimension of is at least\n7. Our study includes vertex guarding problems under different visibility definitions.\nFirst we solve the vertex guarding problem under one specular reflection. Then we\nconsider art gallery problems under rectilinear visibility and present an O(n 2 )-time and\nO(log n)-factor approximation algorithm for the vertex guarding problem. We present\na linear time algorithm for computing the visibility polygon under rectilinear visibility,\nfrom an interior point. We also prove that the VC-dimension of visibility systems under\nrectilinear visibility outside the minimum rectangle that encloses the points is d \u2208 [4, 5].\nFor polygons with holes we show that the VC-dimension is at least 5.", "Start Date": "5/2013", "End Date": "5/2013"}], "ORGANISATIONS": [{"Name of Organisation": "Directi", "Position Held": "Software Engineer", "Start Date": "7/2014", "End Date": "Present"}], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": []}
