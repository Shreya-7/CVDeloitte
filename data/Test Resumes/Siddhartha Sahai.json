PostgreSQL server was used for data storage. WSGI compatible scripts were written for the Broker machine which were executed when an HTTPS request was sent by the Central Server or the Hosts.\n\nThe following features were implemented:-\n1. Two mechanisms (called the push mode and pull mode) were implemented for transport.\n2. A configuration manager with a CLI that can be used to configure the various hosts from the Central Server.\n3. An authentication module for this transport mechanism.\n4. A provision for multiple subscribers (central servers) to monitor the hosts.\n5. An Installation package (for Linux) was made so that any component (Central Server, Broker or Host) can be deployed on a machine. More than one component can be installed on the same machine.", "Start Date": "5/2014", "End Date": "7/2014"}, {"Title of Project": "Development of an SDN Aware TCP Module", "Description": "The Linux TCP retransmission and congestion control modules were modified so as to collect information regarding network traffic and speed precisely from an SDN controller and use it to set packet transmission rates.", "Start Date": "8/2014", "End Date": "12/2015"}, {"Title of Project": "Website for Parishodh", "Description": "Parishodh is a joint initiative by NSS and Nirmaan, BITS Pilani.
