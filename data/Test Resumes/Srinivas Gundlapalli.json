Similarly, the users can like/dislike posts, post their comments on existing posts, all in-place. All this is achieved by AJAX requests made in the background which provide faster response to the user input while also providing a seamless user experience. In addition, the application also provides infinite scrolling feature which enables users to potentially scroll through all the blog posts in the different views(home page, user profile page, e.t.c.,) that are presented.\n\nKey Technologies: Spring framework, jQuery, MongoDB and Thymeleaf"}, {"Title of Project": "Swift File Search - A content based file search tool", "Description": "Swift File Search is an index based file search utility that searches one or more files on the Computer for occurrences of an input query and displays the results in the order of their relevance.
