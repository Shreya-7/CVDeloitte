The purpose of the project was to efficiently cluster a given graph, that is to group similar nodes of the graph together and separate from the other nodes. Similarity was determined based on mathematical formulae. Implementation was done in C."}, {"Title of Project": "Hypercubes and Maximal Matching", "Description": "Currently pursuing a research based project along with our  Head Of the Department (CSE Heritage Institute Of Technology ) on Hypercubes and maximal matchings. The aim of the paper is to prove that the range of matched edges in a maximal matching in a Hypercube of order n is from 3*2^(n-3) to 2^(n-1). We have been able to prove that the lower bound for the number of matched edges is at least 8/9 of our intended value of 3*2^(n-3)"}], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [{"Title": "IBM MASTER THE MAINFRAME CONTEST", "Issue Date": "12/2012"}, {"Title": "Speaker at the JQuery Conference, 2015, Bangalore", "Issue Date": "7/2015"}], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": [{"Language Name": "English", "Proficiency": "FULL_PROFESSIONAL"}, {"Language Name": "Hindi", "Proficiency": "NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL"}, {"Language Name": "Bengali", "Proficiency": "NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL"}]}
