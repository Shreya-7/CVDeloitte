So to guard our luggage, we usually lock our luggage through the old methods with the help of lock and chain. After all these, we still stay in fear that any thief may break the chain and take away all the valuable things. To overcome this problem, here is a system, namely luggage security alarm circuit which is based on the NAND gate. The main aim of this system is to generate an alarm when any unauthorized person tries to steal your luggage. This system is very useful when you travel in the night time. Another application of this luggage security alarm system is, you can use in your home for the security from the theft.\n\nWe used following components:\nIC1(CD4011) \u2013 1(In a single chip, it is a group of 4 NAND Gate which are independent of each other)\nResistor\nR1(1K) \u2013 1\nR2(4.7K) \u2013 1\nCapacitor\nC1(.1uF) \u2013 1\nMiscellaneous\nBuzzer\u2013 1\nT1(BC547) \u2013 1\nD1(1N4007) \u2013 1\n\n\n", "Start Date": "2/2016", "End Date": "2/2016"}, {"Title of Project": "Admin Portal of Fundoo Notes", "Description": "This is the Admin section of Fundoo Notes Application which is same as Google Keep.Here I used JQuery & Bootstrap additionally.This admin portal is for Admin only where one can see the number of users & user details.Admin have a power to approve questions asked by user and Services also.", "Start Date": "11/2018", "End Date": "11/2018"}, {"Title of Project": "STUDY & DEVELOPMENT OF TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM", "Description": "Traffic lights, also known as traffic signals, traffic lamps, signal lights, robots  are signaling devices positioned at or near road intersections, pedestrian crossings and other locations to control competing flows of traffic. Traffic lights were first installed in 1868 in London, United Kingdom; now used in almost every city of the world. Traffic lights alternate the right of way accorded to road users by displaying lights of a standard color (red, yellow/amber, and green) following a universal color code (and a precise sequence to enable comprehension by those who are color blind). \n\nWe used Atmega32 for auto-change signal after a specific time of interval.We also used LED lights as  a indicator.
