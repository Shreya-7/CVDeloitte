{"NAME": "Sudipro Ghosh", "ABOUT": "The world is chaotic.\n\nTo make sense of it, I have always tried to model what I see into deterministic frameworks. Programming was a natural extension of that mindset and quickly became a part of who I am.\n\nThis has led me to interning at Microsoft and eventually getting an offer there. But learning more about programming remains my primary goal and thus I'm looking for an opportunity where I can continue learning.\n\nI have experience in building distributed systems, real-time messaging systems and image processing.", "EDUCATION": [{"Institute Name": "Patha Bhavan", "Degree Name": "NA", "Field of Study": "NA"}, {"Institute Name": "Jadavpur University", "Degree Name": "Bachelor's degree", "Field of Study": "Information Technology"}], "SKILLS": ["Data Structures", "Java", "C++", "Android Development", "Linux", "NoSQL", "JavaScript", "Data Engineering", "Machine Learning", "Apache Spark", "Scala", "Software Development", "Algorithm Design", "Python", "SQL", "Problem Solving", "Algorithms", "C", "Big Data", "Hadoop"], "EXPERIENCE": [{"Company Name": "Microsoft", "Designation": "SDE Internhip", "Location": "Hyderabad Area, India", "Start Date": "5/2019", "End Date": "7/2019"}], "LICENSES & CERTIFICATION": [{"Authority": "Coursera", "Name": "Machine Learning", "Issue Date": "3/2018"}, {"Authority": "Coursera", "Name": "Functional Programming in Scala Specialization", "Issue Date": "10/2018"}], "COURSES COMPLETED": [], "PROJECTS TAKEN": [], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": []}
