In the countries of the Organisation\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the total healthcare expenditure has grown\nat an average of 4% per year from 2000 to 2009, of which hospitals account for 29% (OECD,\n2013). More than 30% of hospital costs are linked to logistics activities (Rais et al., 2018).\nPatient flows are the primary flows, which are the drivers of all other flows and activities. The outpatient clinic has a critical role as a large proportion of healthcare delivery shifts from inpatient facilities to outpatient facilities (Hong et al., 2013). Methods for efficient management of patient flow in an outpatient clinic is increasingly being demanded. Simulation approaches are widely used by researchers in healthcare services due to the problem complexity.It is important to map and summarise the existing knowledge base of this domain for a better understanding. This research presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the patient-flow logistics in healthcare modelled using simulation. Also, we build a simulation model of an ophthalmic outpatient hospital using FlexSim Healthcare (version 5.3.10) and suggested strategies to reduce the waiting time and to improve the patient flow.", "Start Date": "1/2019", "End Date": "6/2019"}, {"Title of Project": "Engine familiarization & torque analysis of soft joints.", "Description": "Above mentioned Project was performed in Tata Cummins Ltd,Jamshedpur.", "Start Date": "5/2014", "End Date": "6/2014"}, {"Title of Project": "Obtainability of capability indices during optimization for finishing pass end milling of EN-24 steel through Grey Relational Analysis", "Description": "The present investigation incorporates parametric optimization for machining (finish cut) of EN-24 steel through entropy assisted Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) which is still in its emerging stage as divulged in literature review. In order to obtain a better surface quality (lower Ra, Rz and Rmax), Central composite Design of experiment was conducted for process parameters, those are spindle speed (N), feed rate (f) and depth of cut (t) all at three levels during end milling operation for the above mentioned material. The optimal process parameters based on grey relational analysis for high speed finish cut CNC milling of EN-24 tool steel within the present process layout include 6000 rpm spindle speed, 500 mm/min as feed rate and 0.1 mm depth of cut. The grey response table as well as the regression analysis reveals that spindle speed is the most noteworthy parameter in dictating the GRG followed by feed and depth of cut. The process capability index ( Cpi ) for Ra, Rmax, Rz were calculated and were found to be 1.959995, 2.88753 and 2.24421 respectively for given USLs 4 \u00b5m, 11 \u00b5m and 10\u00b5m for Ra, Rmax and Rz respectively. Analysis revealed that optimal capability index value of` 1.33 can be obtained if the upper specification values should be limited to 3.43, 11.61 and 10.78 for Ra, Rmax, and Rz respectively.

Waiting time is an important consideration when we talk about the efficiency regarding procedures and cost-effectiveness because if high, it can lead to patient dissatisfaction,\npoor outcome of the treatment lost appointment and failure or delay in the start of basic treatment.\nThis project aimed to find the significant factors affecting the waiting time of a patient in an ophthalmology outpatient clinic with the help of Multiple linear regression analysis in SPSS version 21.0.0.0 and to predict the waiting time of a patient based on the same factors using a machine learning technique called Random Forest method in R studio version 1.1.423 software. During regression, the assumptions like heteroskedasticity, the normality of the dependent variable, multicollinearity, linear regression relationship are verified.\nThe data has been taken from an ophthalmology outpatient clinic in Tiruchirappalli which includes several factors like Gender, Age, Distance, Treatment type, Day of visit, time of visit, Total waiting time of a patient during all procedures, Education and Occupation status of the patient.
