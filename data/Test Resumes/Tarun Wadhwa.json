The ideators\u2019 and designers\u2019 first choice is sketching the idea to conceptualize the product. After a few iterations of product design mockups/prototypes are passed on to developers who have the job to convert these designs into a functional product by grasping the design concepts and using their coding skills. Work stops whenever one discipline finishes a portion of the project and passes responsibility to another discipline.\n\nSketchX is a system that understands what a designer has drawn on a whiteboard and can translate that understanding to HTML code. This way we can generate HTML wireframes directly from a hand-drawn image giving an instant working design implementation thus streamlining the design process.\nThe steps to be performed by the user will be:\n1. Draw a sketch of design on the whiteboard/paper\n2. Capture an image of sketch\n3. Upload the image to a web service\n4. Download functional, bootstrap code for the sketch\nThe product aims to provide these features in the form of web service for ease of accessibility and all the computational requirement to generate the output being handled by our server.
