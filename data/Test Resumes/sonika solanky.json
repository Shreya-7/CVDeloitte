These failures can happen due to multiple reasons such as memory limit reached, grid killed due to time limitation. \n\nAs another part of this project, I have been able to reduce the peek disk usage by more than 60% by deleting waveform files which have been used by clients. This helps users which have a disk foot print of more that 2 TB.\n\n\nThis project has helped in making HDL developers efficient by more than ~90%. \n", "Start Date": "7/2015", "End Date": "9/2015"}], "ORGANISATIONS": [], "HONOR & AWARD": [], "LANGUAGES KNOWN": [{"Language Name": "Hindi", "Proficiency": "FULL_PROFESSIONAL"}, {"Language Name": "English", "Proficiency": "FULL_PROFESSIONAL"}]}
